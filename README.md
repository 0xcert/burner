# 0xcert Burner

A dedicated smart contract was built for anyone to send their ZXC tokens to and burn them. This contract is **the sole owner** of the ZXC smart contract.

This unique mechanism enables ZXC token to be controlled by the market and **not owned by anyone**. That decision personalize team's dedication to the 0xcert project and to the greater decentralized future.

With the form bellow anyone can participate and permanently burn desired amount of ZXC tokens from their wallet. This will decrease a total token supply and consequently increase the token value.
